# Datasets
#### A collection of datasets that I have used:

Airfare--quarterly airfare for the 100 busiest airports in the United States from Q1 2015-Q4 2019, for a total of 20 quarters. Includes indicator variables for seasons and region (official US Census Bureau classifications with the exception of Puerto Rico, which was placed in the South).

Piano--A dataset of used grand pianos over $10,000 listed on an online marketplace. Variables are brand, model year, age (years), the piano has a satin or glossy ebony finish (ebony = 1), length (cm), the piano has undergone any amount of restoration (restored = 1), the piano contains any sort of added electronics like a player system (electronics = 1), and the piano is advertised as being unique in any way (unique = 1). Higher-tier brands are chosen based on their presence in a published article about high-end pianos and/or having substantial global market share.
