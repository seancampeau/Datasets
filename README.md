# Datasets
#### A collection of datasets that I have created and used:

Airfare--quarterly airfare for the 100 busiest airports in the United States from Q1 2015-Q4 2019, for a total of 20 quarters. Includes indicator variables for seasons and region (by official US Census Bureau classifications with the exception of Puerto Rico, which was placed in the South).

Piano--a dataset of used grand pianos from 8 brands generally considered high-end listed for over $10,000 in an online marketplace. Variables are brand, age (years), length (cm), the piano's finish is anything but an ebony finish (ebony = 1), any amount of restoration has been completed (restored = 1), any sort of electronics have been added (electronics = 1), advertised as being unique in any way (unique = 1).
